# Forecasting-Bus-Demand-in-Banana-Republic-Municipalities
## The central urban planning commitee of Banana Republic asked you to help them with the forecast of bus demands of municipalities. And they provide a nice dataset to support you (https://pi.works/3w8IJbV).
The dataset includes two measurements for an hour for the number of used buses in each municipality, each measurement is timestamped. The dataset format is as follows (comma separated values):

MUNICIPALITY_ID, TIMESTAMP, USAGE, TOTAL_CAPACITY
- You may look at the one of the solution approach found in kaggle using the link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/berkantaslan/forecasting-bus-demand-in-banana-municipalities/notebookApplication 
- Forecasting of hourly different buses usages has been predicted by the time series solution using LSTM in Tensorflow.
